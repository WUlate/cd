# Collection Descriptions IG navigation page

The [Collection Descriptions Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/cd/) is the parent [interest group](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/) that is chartering a task group to develop a Collection Descriptions metadata standard.

The new Collection Descriptions standard will be a successor to the unratified draft [Natural Collections Description data standard](https://github.com/tdwg/ncd/tree/master/NCD-v090_TDWG), whose development has been discontinued.

The day-to-day operations of the Interest Group is documented in the group's [Github repository](https://github.com/tdwg/cd).  You can also track and participate in the work of the group by watching that repository and monitoring its [issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/issues).
