This is the repository for the Collections Description Interest Group.

## About the group

The [Collections Description Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/cd/) is the parent [interest group](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/) that is chartering a task group to develop a Collections Description metadata standard.

The new Collections Descriptions standard will be a successor to the unratified draft [Natural Collections Description data standard](https://github.com/tdwg/ncd/tree/master/NCD-v090_TDWG), whose development has been discontinued.

The day-to-day operations of the Interest Group is documented in this repository. You can also track and participate in the work of the group by watching this repository and monitoring the group's [issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/issues).
