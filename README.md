# Collection Descriptions Interest Group

This is the repository for the Collection Descriptions Interest Group.

## About the group

The [Collection Descriptions Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/cd/) is the parent [interest group](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/) that is chartering a task group to develop a Collection Descriptions metadata standard.

The new Collection Descriptions standard will be a successor to the unratified draft [Natural Collections Description data standard](https://github.com/tdwg/ncd/tree/master/NCD-v090_TDWG), whose development has been discontinued.

The day-to-day operations of the Interest Group is documented in this repository. You can also track and participate in the work of the group by watching this repository and monitoring the group's [issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/cd/issues).
